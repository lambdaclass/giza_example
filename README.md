# giza_example

## Error replication
```
git clone git@github.com:lambdaclass/giza_example.git
cd giza_example
cargo run
```

## Explanation 
We start with the following cairo program:

```
%builtins output
from starkware.cairo.common.serialize import serialize_word

func main{output_ptr: felt*}() {
    tempvar x = 10;
    tempvar y = x + x;
    tempvar z = y * y + x;
    serialize_word(x);
    serialize_word(y);
    serialize_word(z);
    return ();
}

``` 

This cairo program is compiled using
```
cairo-compile program.cairo --output program.json
```

then, the memory and trace files are generated using

```
cairo-run --program program.json --trace_file trace.bin --layout all --memory_file memory.bin
```

The code panics in this line from `main.rs`
```
let (_proof, _pub_inputs) = giza_prover::prove_trace(trace, &proof_options).unwrap();
```

with the following error
```
